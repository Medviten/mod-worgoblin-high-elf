# Workflow
1. Set up the DBCTools config file and import clean DBCs (change the database name each time if you want to import different DBCs to compare them with DBC_diff)
2. Make a dump (export) of your squeaky clean DBCs, or make support tables you'll need first
3. Set up the build-dbc config file and point it at the directories containing your SQL files and/or your testworld server
4. Wait for the tool to finish, then copy the exported DBC files to your client patch
